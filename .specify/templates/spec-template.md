# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST implement authentication using Better Auth with JWT-based verification
- **FR-002**: System MUST enforce user authorization and data isolation at query level
- **FR-003**: Users MUST only see and manage their own data/tasks
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate all requests with a valid JWT token
- **FR-005**: System MUST return proper HTTP status codes for all API endpoints
- **FR-006**: System MUST persist data using Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
- **FR-007**: System MUST follow REST API contracts as specified
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate all request/response data explicitly

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-009**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific business logic requirement not specified]
- **FR-010**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific UI/UX requirement not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can securely sign up and sign in using Better Auth
- **SC-002**: Authenticated users can only see and manage their own tasks
- **SC-003**: All CRUD task operations work as specified with proper authentication
- **SC-004**: JWT authentication works correctly across frontend and backend
- **SC-005**: Database persists data correctly across sessions using Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
- **SC-006**: Application behaves correctly under multi-user usage with proper data isolation
- **SC-007**: All specifications are implemented without violating security constraints
- **SC-008**: API endpoints return proper HTTP status codes for all request types
